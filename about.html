    This library was designed to support complex and large entreprise web 2.0 
    applications. 
  </p>
  <p>
    It is quick to learn, fast to run and safe to depend on.
  </p>
  <h2>Web Protocols</h2>
  <p>
    Like most AJAX libraries <code>protocols.js</code> attempts to 
    bridge the compatibility gap between browsers, although on a smaller 
    set of interfaces, providing conveniences to leverage a stable stack 
    of web protocols: HTTP, HTML, CSS and JSON.
  </p>
  <p>
    Call it SOA, ROA or - more appropriately - a Representational State 
    Transfer architecture, the design of a web applications is constrained 
    first by the protocols they implement. So, your mileage of application 
    server systems, languages or APIs may vary, <em>if their protocols do 
    not</em>.
  </p>
  <h2>For JavaScript</h2>
  <p>
    The 700th implementation of a Lisp interpreter in C clothing does 
    <em>not</em> suck.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, I did not bend JavaScript like Ruby (<a 
    href="http://www.prototypejs.org/"
    >prototype</a>), Python (<a 
    href="http://mochikit.com/"
    >mochikit</a>) or Java (<a 
    href="http://www.dojotoolkit.org/"
    >Dojo</a>).
  </p>
  <p>
    Nor did I try to reimplement yet another framework for throwable 
    web applications. If you need one, use <a 
    href="http://jquery.com/"
    >jQuery</a>. This library was writen to get entreprise web applications 
    developers where less is more, now and in long run.
  </p>
  <p>
    The absence of a ton of abstractions or another language emulation 
    makes <code>protocol.js</code> easier to learn and ensure that its 
    applications are reliable, load fast and run quick enough.
  </p>
  <h2>Applications</h2>
  <p>
    I use <code>protocols.js</code> to develop model-driven user interfaces 
    for web application services programmed in JavaScript, Java or CPython. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Positionning, effects, drag &amp; drop or most browser bugs are not 
    supported: entreprise applications should not be developped on broken 
    programming interfaces or depend all the HTML and CSS 
    incompatibilies between web browsers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Making an application look good in the eyes of its users demands to make 
    it perform quickly and without fault. Dressing up ad-hoc HTML templates 
    and sleek CSS styles on every browsers supported can be done later, 
    concurrently and without changes to JavaScript programs.
