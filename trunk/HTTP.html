  <p>
    The <code>HTTP</code> client provides reliable support accross browsers 
    for asynchronous requests with timeouts and without redundant submission.
  </p>
  <p>
    Synchronous requests and multiple client abstractions give their 
    applications just enough rope to hang themselves high. When applications 
    <em>need</em> a synchronous state transition from
    a web controller, it should be executed either as a transition to a new
    URL (ie: to a new page) or as a &quot;modal&quot; user interface closed
    by an asynchronous callback (keeping the ability to &quot;abort&quot;
    the request).
  </p>
  <h3>HTTP.requests</h3>
  <p>
    The <code>HTTP</code> client maintains a dictionnary of request 
    objects, indexed by keys made of their HTTP method and URL requested.
  </p>
  <p> 
    This dictionnary acts as a filter to prevent redundant POST
    or GET requests to be submitted. It is usefull to inspect
    the current pending requests:
  </p>
  <pre class="synopsis"
    >HTTP.request('GET', 'hello-world.js', {}, null, alert);
for (var k in <strong>HTTP.requests</strong>) alert(k);</pre>
  <p>
    Applications may also use <code>HTTP.requests</code> test the state of 
    a pending requests by name, something practical when the state inspector 
    is out of the request original scope and cannot possibly have a reference 
    to the request object.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is probably not one of the most visible interface in this namespace
    but you should be glad it exist and is used to do the right thing.
