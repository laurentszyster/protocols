    If the network is the computer then protocols are its application 
    programming interfaces.
  </p>
  <p>
    Protocols lets architects, programmers and designers leverage a stable
    stack of protocols to produce together large and complex applications 
    made of many simple parts.
  </p>
  <h2>Web Protocols</h2>
  <p>
    Like most AJAX libraries <code>protocols.js</code> attempts to 
    bridge the compatibility gap between browsers, although on a smaller 
    set of interfaces, providing conveniences to leverage four defacto
    standard web protocols: HTTP, HTML, CSS and JSON.
  </p>
  <p>
    Call it SOA, ESB or - more appropriately - a <a
    href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm"
    >Representational State Transfer</a> architecture, the design of a web 
    applications is constrained first by the protocols they implement. 
    Your mileage of application server systems, languages or APIs may vary, 
    <em>if their protocols do not</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    To deliver an application that meets its entreprise requirements on time
    and budget, <code>protocols.js</code> supports a model driven architecture
    where blueprints are written directly using the text protocols applied: 
    JSON for object modeling; CSS and HTML for presentation; HTTP for network 
    integration. 
  </p>
  <h2>For JavaScript</h2>
  <p>
    The 700th implementation of a Lisp interpreter in C clothing does 
    <em>not</em> suck.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, I did not bend JavaScript like Ruby / <a 
    href="http://www.prototypejs.org/"
    >Prototype</a>, Python / <a 
    href="http://mochikit.com/"
    >Mochikit</a> or Java / <a 
    href="http://www.dojotoolkit.org/"
    >Dojo</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nor did I try to reimplement yet another framework for throwable 
    web applications. If you need one, use <a 
    href="http://jquery.com/"
    >jQuery</a>, <a 
    href="http://extjs.com"
    >Ext</a> and <a 
    href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/"
    >YUI</a>. This library was made to get entreprise web applications 
    developers where less is more, now and in long run.
  </p>
  <p>
    Visual effects are tricky to run reliably accross browsers, drag and drop 
    has allways been a gimmick with too many pitfalls for its users and GUI 
    widgets in a web browser are pure non-senses.
  </p>
  <p>
    This library won't raise back the client/server zombie APIs back from the 
    80's.
  </p>
  <p>
    The absence of a ton of abstractions, a questionable widgetry or another 
    language emulation makes <code>protocol.js</code> easier to learn and 
    ensures that its applications are reliable, small and fast enough.
  </p>
  <h2>Entreprise Applications</h2>
  <p>
    This library won't raise the client/server zombie APIs back from the 
    80's.
  </p>
  <p>
    A large and complex web of entreprise services is easier to grow 
    and to maintain when it is articulated as independant HTML pages, CSS 
    style sheets and JSON models.
  </p>
  <p>
    Visual effects are tricky to run reliably accross browsers, drag and drop 
    has allways been a gimmick with too many pitfalls for its users and GUI 
    widgets in a web browser are non-senses. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Dressing up ad-hoc HTML templates and sleek CSS styles on every browsers 
    supported can be done separately, concurrently and without changes to 
    JavaScript applications of Protocols.
