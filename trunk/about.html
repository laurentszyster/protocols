  <h2>Web Protocols</h2>
  <p>
    Like most AJAX libraries <code>protocols.js</code> attempts to 
    bridge the compatibility gap between browsers, although on a smaller 
    set of interfaces, providing conveniences to leverage a stable stack 
    of web protocols: HTTP, HTML, CSS and JSON.
  </p>
  <p>
    Call it SOA, ROA or - more appropriately - a <a
    href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm"
    >Representational State Transfer</a> architecture, the design of a web 
    applications is constrained first by the protocols they implement. 
    Your mileage of application server systems, languages or APIs may vary, 
    <em>if their protocols do not</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    To deliver an application that meets its entreprise requirements on time
    and budget, <code>protocols.js</code> supports a model driven architecture
    where blueprints are written directly using the text protocols applied. 
    Starting with JSON for object modeling, CSS and HTML for presentation, 
    HTTP for integration. This library is designed to <em>leverage</em> web 
    protocols, allowing analysts, programmers and web designers work
    independantly from each other but as efficiently as if they were one.
  </p>
  <h2>For JavaScript</h2>
  <p>
    The 700th implementation of a Lisp interpreter in C clothing does 
    <em>not</em> suck.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, I did not bend JavaScript like Ruby (<a 
    href="http://www.prototypejs.org/"
    >Prototype</a>), Python (<a 
    href="http://mochikit.com/"
    >Mochikit</a>) or Java (<a 
    href="http://www.dojotoolkit.org/"
    >Dojo</a>).
  </p>
  <p>
    Nor did I try to reimplement yet another framework for throwable 
    web applications. If you need one, use <a 
    href="http://jquery.com/"
    >jQuery</a>, <a 
    href="http://extjs.com"
    >Ext</a> or both. This library was writen to get entreprise web applications 
    developers where less is more, now and in long run.
  </p>
  <p>
    The absence of a ton of abstractions or another language emulation 
    makes <code>protocol.js</code> easier to learn and ensures 
    that its applications are reliable, small and fast enough.
  </p>
  <h2>Entreprise Applications</h2>
  <p>
    I use <code>protocols.js</code> to develop model-driven user interfaces 
    for entreprise web applications. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Making an application look good in the eyes of all its users demands to 
    perform it quickly and without fault everywhere. Dressing up ad-hoc HTML 
    templates and sleek CSS styles on every browsers supported can be done 
    separately, concurrently and without changes to JavaScript programs.
  </p>  
  <p>  
    Note that positionning, effects, drag &amp; drop or most browser bugs are 
    not supported by this library. Fancy visual effects in JavaScript are 
    expensive and tricky to run accross plateforms. Drag and drop has allways 
    been a gimmick with many pitfalls for its users and GUI widgets in a web 
    browser are non-senses.
  </p>
  <p>
    Entreprise applications should not be 
    developped on broken programming interfaces or depend all the HTML and 
    <a 
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_layout_engines_%28CSS%29"
      >CSS</a> incompatibilies between web browsers. 
    To deliver get great user interfaces everywhere as quickly as possible
    and at the best available price the best possible course of action is
    to distribute the effort and distribute the work between many web 
    designers, up to one by software and hardware plateform supported.
