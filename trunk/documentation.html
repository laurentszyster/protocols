    This library provides a collection of conveniences that 
    implement the cross-browser boilerplate code required by all Web 2.0 
    applications:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <dt><a href="functions.html">Functions</a><dt>
      <dd>Four general conveniences for JavaScript.</dd>
    </li>
    <li>
      <dt><a href="HTTP.html">HTTP</a></dt>
      <dd>
        A statefull HTTP client that provides reliable support accross 
        browsers for asynchronous requests for text responses, with timeouts 
        and without redundant submission.
      </dd>
    </di>
    <li>
      <dt><a href="HTML.html">HTML</a></dt>
      <dd>
        Update, replace and insert HTML markup; Add or remove CSS classes; 
        Serialize a query string from HTML form input values; Escape text as 
        valid CDATA.
      </dd>
    </li>
    <li>
      <dt><a href="JSON.html">JSON</a></dt>
      <dd>
        Encode and decode JSON strings; GET or POST requests for a JSON 
        response with URLencoded or JSON payload; Template JSON objects 
        into HTML markup; Update, replace and insert in an HTML page the 
        templated JSON responses.
      </dd>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    In as far as possible, each interface is documented with the synopsis
    of an online test case. Such active synopsis change their left border
    color from grey to orange when hovered and execute their code when 
    clicked.
  </p>
  <pre class="synopsis">alert('synopsis');</pre>
  <p>
    Usually, synopsis yield a simple message box with the result of a
    function, method or callback.
  </p>  
  <p>
    Interfaces that interact with the HTML page also use the orange color 
    on hover to highlight where the page is active, as seen in the 
    &quot;Hello World!&quot; test case.
  </p>
  <h3>About This Implementation</h3>
  <p>
    JavaScript has a bad reputation, but 
    <em>this</em> 700th implementation of a Lisp interpreter in Java
    clothing does <em>not</em> suck.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, I did not bend JavaScript like Ruby (<a 
    href="http://www.prototypejs.org/"
    >prototype</a>), Python (<a 
    href="http://mochikit.com/"
    >mochikit</a>) or Java (<a 
    href="http://www.dojotoolkit.org/"
    >Dojo</a>).
  </p>
  <p>
    Neither did I try to reimplement yet another framework for glamourous 
    throwable web applications. This library was writen for profitable
    investments, for entreprise web applications development to get where less 
    is more now and in long run.
  </p>
  <p>
    This library has been tested with stable versions of Firefox and Internet 
    Explorer only, does not do effects or drag-n-drop and weights less than 
    4KB once minified and compressed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Like most JavaScript libraries <code>protocols.js</code> attempts to bridge
    the compatibility gap between browsers, although on a smaller set of 
    interfaces and with a special focus on names.
  </p>
  <p>
    With a tall stack made of JSON, HTTP, HTML and CSS to apply
    from the client, it does not hurt to have simple JavaScript API
    for these protocols and proper names.
