/**
 * A really simple class file loader, for applications that need to reload
 * simple parts or restrict classes to a file system path.
 * 
 * @h3 Note
 * 
 * @p To be used only when JavaScript is too slow, when generating Java is
 * forced upon your application by speed constraints ... out of a long-running
 * daemon that is also constrained by memory (when running out of RAM for new
 * classes is not an option).
 * 
 * @p Don't even think to glorify this into some kind of mighty
 * be-all-do-all uberClassLoader. Production Java applications are not 
 * actually expected to reload their classes byte code, they are supposed 
 * to JIT that once for all. And when they do demand classes, a configurable 
 * file system restriction is all you will ever practically use. Loading classes 
 * from the network, from a signed and compressed archive may sound cool but have 
 * little practical use in case of reload.
 * 
 * @p Reloading large JARs with many dependencies is a recipe for worse than 
 * failure. Restart the JVM instead.
 * 
 * @p Loading byte code from the network open the door for too many exploit.
 * Instead, use SVN to update the application's components.
